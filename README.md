<h1 align="center">phaseScrape</h1>

## Description
phaseScrape scrapes the text of a website for a count of how many times a user-inputted phrase was found. Python was 
chosen for its readability and syntax, both important parts of an open-source program. In the future, I would like to
add support for searching multiple phrases, an option for case insensitivity, and more user friendly URL input.

## Running the Program
Run main.py, scraper.py does not have input or output. To run main.py, simply install python, navigate to the parent 
folder in your terminal, and run the command 'python3 main.py' in the terminal.

## Using the Program
'Enter URL' is used to enter the URL of the website you're scraping. Make sure the URL contains https or http, the 
program does not support URLs without it. This may be fixed in the future. 'Enter Phrase' is used to enter the phrase
you are searching for. The search is case sensitive, so pay attention to how you intend to search the term. The 
option to switch between case sensitive and case insensitive may be added in the future as well.
